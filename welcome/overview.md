# Training overview

* Are you concerned about viruses and malware? 
* Do you hate it when your computer is running slow or crashes? 
* Are you looking for stability and dependability? 
* Do you like free things?

Ubuntu is a free and open source Linux distribution. We recommend Linux to researchers at the University of Melbourne because most research software is written on and for Linux.

This training will provide a gentle introduction to basic Ubuntu usage, including logging into a virtual machine, basic commands in the terminal, sudo commands, installing software on Ubuntu, and transferring data to and from your virtual machine.

### Learning objectives

This training aims to enable students to:

* [ ] familiarise themselves with the Ubuntu desktop and find for applications such as Git, LaTeX, MATLAB, Python, RStudio and a text editor;
* [ ] use basic terminal commands such as ls and cd;
* [ ] install software using sudo commands;
* [ ] access data on their virtual machine.

### Learning outcomes: Research methodology

* Analytical skills: the ability to construct and express logical arguments and to work in abstract or general terms to increase the clarity and efficiency of analysis;
* Computational skills: the ability to adapt existing computational methods and tools to complete a target task;
* Problem solving skills: the ability to engage with unfamiliar problems and identify relevant solution strategies.
