Hi, I'm Meirian.

I am a teacher, consultant and senior community co-ordinator at the University of Melbourne. I offer training in Ubuntu and LaTeX at Research Computing Services. My other areas of interest include data analysis, operations research and statistics, which I also have the pleasure of teaching at the University. I love teaching and am enthusiastic about enabling others to benefit from the skills that I teach! 

Get in touch with me for more information about Ubuntu training, events, and community support:
